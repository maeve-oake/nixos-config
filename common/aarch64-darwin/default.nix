    TODO: investigate linking apps from the nix store to spotlight / environment and have then indexed
          currently, apps installed via Brew do show up properly but ones installed via Nix must be launched from /Applications/Nix Apps
          vscode seems to have some issues when installed via nix (asks for helper script installs on every reboot)

          they ARE linked in /Applications/Nix apps, so i guess we just need to get it to *actually index*?

          If brew just turns out to be better, look into immutable taps! this will provide the immutability of Nix without the problems of nixpkgs
